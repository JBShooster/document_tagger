Document Tagger uses regular expressions to parse through metadata of texts derived from Project Guternberg, The Divine Comedy, and The Magna Carta.

Script1.py shows the metadata for the first index of 'pg_sample_texts.py' but for some reason, most of the information is missing for the second index. Wonder why...

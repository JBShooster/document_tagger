Document Tagger uses regular expressions to parse through metadata of texts derived from Project Guternberg, The Divine Comedy, and The Magna Carta.

Script1.py is intentionally flawed as it only shows the information from the first index of the DOCUMENTS list. Script2.py will fix the code to reveal the metadata information from both indexes.
